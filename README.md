# Personal-Portfolio
After coding for the last 10 years, I think it’s time to finally get an online portfolio to properly display everything I’ve done

I wanted something that I can just, have, and not have to update every so often, or look at much, for that matter. So it automatically fetches my information from the GitHub API, and handles it all by itself.

If you wanna use it for your own page, feel free to (as long as you follow the license, of course). You just need to change the `API_URL` variable in `script.js` to your own API endpoint. I'd recommend using your user ID instead of your username, because, well, you might wanna change your username, and that can fuck stuff up. Have fun with your automated new portfolio! :D
